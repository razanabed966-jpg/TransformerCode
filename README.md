🤖 Transformers Module – Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains all the practical projects completed as part of the Transformers module in the Advanced Artificial Intelligence Course.
The module explores both theoretical and practical concepts of Transformer architectures, which form the foundation of modern AI models such as GPT, BERT, and LLaMA.
It also includes applied projects that integrate artificial intelligence into real-world domains such as e-commerce, restaurants, hotels, and service centers.

🧠 Overview

The goal of this module is to understand how Transformers process and generate human language through:

Attention Mechanisms

Encoder–Decoder Architectures

Fine-Tuning Techniques for pre-trained models


These projects combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation to build real, interactive AI solutions.
